# Restaurant-GUI
This is a modified version of a group project for my Visual C# class at UMSL.
For this group project, my group had elected me to complete the coding behind their idea.  Without depleting their original concept, I had expanded upon their original vision to create this app.
**See the Microsoft Word Doc inside the files for an explanation, with screenshots, of what the code output looks like.**
